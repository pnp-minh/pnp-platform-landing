# Demo Flow Design - Psychology & Structure

**Current Focus**: Version A (Revenue Growth) - Version B (Knowledge Retention) scheduled for next week

**Product Name**: Primer (formerly JAY - all references updated)

## Core Principles for Both Versions

### Psychology Rules:

1. **Instant gratification**: Wow moment in <60 seconds
2. **User agency**: User DOES something (not just watches)
3. **Progressive disclosure**: Don't show everything at once
4. **Emotional peak-end**: Best moment at middle, strong close
5. **Social proof injection**: "X agencies are testing this" somewhere visible

### UX Rules:

1. **No login required** for demo
2. **Pre-filled data** for speed (but user can edit)
3. **Live feedback**: Every action shows immediate result
4. **Clear progress**: "Step 1 of 3" or progress bar
5. **Embedded CTA**: Waitlist signup appears naturally, not forced

---

## VERSION A: Revenue Growth Demo Flow

**Goal**: Make owner FEEL the efficiency gain and capacity opportunity through experience

**Key Decision**: ❌ **NO ROI Calculator** - We have no real data to support specific claims yet. This is validation, not sales. Let the demo experience be the proof.

### Landing Page → Demo Transition

**Hero Section (Simplified):**

- Headline: "Better Briefs. Less Time. Same Team."
- Subheadline: "Primer is an AI Brief Consultant that handles client intake through chat. Your team receives complete, structured briefs—without the hours of calls and documentation."

**Single Clear CTA:**

```
[Experience Primer] (90 seconds)

✓ No signup required
✓ Personalized for your agency
✓ Takes 90 seconds
```

**Psychology:**

- Relatable pain: "hours → 2 minutes" (not abstract numbers)
- Experience-first: "See it work" vs "Calculate ROI"
- Low barrier: No signup, quick demo
- Curiosity: "How is this possible?" → demo shows them
- Primary concerns addressed: Brief quality + Speed/intelligence (Version A focus)

**Alternative Messaging Options:**

- Problem-first: "Your team spends 3 hours gathering each brief. What if this took 2 minutes instead?"
- Capacity-focused: "Your 5-person team has a growth ceiling. Not because of talent. Because of time."
- Vision-forward: "Scale without scaling costs. See how Primer helps agencies grow."

### Step-by-Step Flow (Version A)

#### STEP 0: Opening Frame - Strategic Context Setting (0:00 - 0:10)

**Critical Addition**: Before demo starts, set proper expectations for agency owner

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Demo Mode: Client Experience                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                      │
│  You're about to experience what YOUR clients will  │
│  see when you send them a brief to complete.        │
│                                                      │
│  For this demo, imagine you're a client being       │
│  asked to brief your agency on a new video project. │
│                                                      │
│  Judge the experience for yourself:                 │
│  • Quality of questions                             │
│  • Speed of the process                             │
│  • Intelligence of AI responses                     │
│                                                      │
│  [Start Demo]                                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Psychology**:
- Sets clear expectation: "You're evaluating this FOR your clients"
- Permission to judge: "Is this good enough for MY clients?"
- Clear evaluation criteria: Quality, speed, intelligence
- Addresses Version A primary concerns: Brief quality + speed/intelligence

**User Mindset Shift**: From "I'm trying a tool" → "I'm evaluating my client's experience"

#### STEP 1: Instant Context (0:15 - 0:30)

Demo loads with:

- Primer already typing (simulated)
- Pre-filled scenario visible

Primer's first message (auto-appears):

```
👋 Hi! I'm Primer, your AI Brief Consultant.

I see you're creating a Video Brief for a new product launch.
I've pulled up your Brand Intelligence - TechStart Inc, B2B SaaS,
enterprise focus.

Let's get this brief done in under 15 minutes. Ready?
```

**Psychology:**

- ✅ Immediate action (no waiting)
- ✅ Shows "Brand Intelligence" feature casually (proper terminology)
- ✅ Time promise creates urgency
- ✅ Introduces "AI Brief Consultant" term naturally

Right panel shows:

- Template sections (empty)
- Timer starts
- Completion: 0%

#### STEP 2: Guided Conversation (0:30 - 1:45)

User can either:

- Type their own response, OR
- Click [Try Quick Demo] button → Auto-plays conversation

**Quick Demo Mode (Recommended Default):**

```
Primer: "What's the main objective of this video?"

[Auto-typed response appears]:
"We want to showcase our new AI analytics feature to enterprise CTOs"

Primer: "Got it. ✓ Objective captured.

[Right panel updates - "Objective" section fills in real-time]

Who's the primary audience for this video?"

[User sees Primer extracting content live into brief sections]
```

**WOW FACTOR #1: Live Extraction Animation**

- As conversation happens, brief sections populate in real-time
- Highlight/flash animation when content is extracted
- Progress bar fills up visibly

**Psychological Hook:**

- Instant gratification: See results immediately
- Automation magic: "I'm just talking, it's organizing itself"
- Speed perception: Conversation feels fast, natural

#### STEP 3: The Speed Comparison (1:30 - 2:00)

After 3-4 exchanges:

```
Primer: "Perfect! I have enough to complete the brief.
Let me organize everything... ✨"

[Brief sections all fill in with beautiful animation]
[Progress bar hits 100%]

┌──────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🎉 Brief Complete!                      │
│                                           │
│  This conversation: 1 min 47 sec         │
│  Your typical process: ~3 hours          │
│                                           │
│  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━          │

│  [Download PDF] [Start Another Brief]   │
└──────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**WOW FACTOR #2: Speed Comparison**

- Show ACTUAL time from their demo (verifiable, honest)
- Compare to typical process (relatable, not exaggerated)
- Simple subtraction (no percentages or projections)
- Focus on experience, not claims

#### STEP 4: Closing Reframe - Agency Owner Value (2:00 - 2:30)

**Critical Addition**: Pivot back to agency owner perspective after client experience

│  💭 Now imagine doing this for every brief.      │
│                                                   │
│  What could your team do with all that time?     │
│  • Take on more clients                          │
│  • Spend time on strategy instead of admin       │
│  • Scale without hiring                          │

```

**Psychology:**

- Reframe: From "I tried a tool" → "I see how this helps MY agency"
- Dual value: Client experience quality + Owner operational value
- Connect to desired outcomes: (1) Try with real clients, (2) Transform operations
- Plant the seed, let THEM do the math
- No specific revenue claims (we have no data to back it up)
- Emphasizes both quality AND speed (primary Version A concerns)

#### STEP 5: Natural Waitlist CTA (2:30)

```
Want Primer for your agency?

We're launching to 50 agencies this quarter.

[Join Waitlist]
└─ "Get early access + 3 months free"

[No thanks, show me more features]
└─ Explore: Brand Intelligence | AI Brief Consultant | Workflow Integration
```

**Psychology:**

- Scarcity: "50 agencies" (limited spots)
- Incentive: "3 months free"
- Low pressure: Option to explore more
- Timing: Right after emotional peak (time savings reveal)

## VERSION B: Knowledge Retention Demo Flow

**Goal**: Make owner FEEL the knowledge loss pain and see the solution

### Landing Page → Demo Transition

**Hero Section:**

- Headline: "When Your Senior AM Quits Next Month, Will You Lose 3 Years of Client Knowledge?"
- Subheadline: "Your agency has trained 12 people in 3 years. They all left. Their knowledge left with them. Stop the bleeding."

**Emotional Hook - Visual Timeline:**

```
2021: Hired Sarah (trained 6 months) ──→ Left 2022
2022: Hired Mike (trained 4 months) ──→ Left 2023
2023: Hired Jenny (trained 6 months) ──→ Left 2024

Total training cost: $120,000
Knowledge retained: $0

[See How Primer Captures Knowledge] → /demo
```

**Psychology:**

- Loss visualization: Timeline makes pain concrete
- Pattern recognition: "This keeps happening"
- Irreversibility: "Knowledge is GONE"

**Psychology:**

- Storytelling: Concrete scenario, not abstract
- Relatable crisis: Every owner has lived this
- Before/After framing: Sets up comparison

#### STEP 2: Knowledge Access Magic (0:20 - 1:00)

Primer appears:

```
Primer: "Hi Alex! I see you're creating a brief for Acme Corp.

Good news - I have context from 12 past projects spanning 2 years.

Primer: "I'll use all this context while we build
your brief. Just talk to me naturally."
```

**WOW FACTOR #1: Knowledge Base Reveal**

- Animated appearance of insights
- Organized by category
- Specific, actionable details (not vague)

**Psychology:**

- Relief: "Oh thank god, I'm not starting from zero"
- Confidence: "I know what this client wants"
- Trust: Specific details = credible

#### STEP 3: Context-Aware Conversation (1:00 - 1:45)

User (Alex) types or auto-demo:

```
User: "We need a product demo video for their new dashboard feature"

Primer: "Perfect. Based on Acme's preferences [1][2], I recommend:

• Keep it under 90 seconds (they hate long videos)
• Lead with ROI/metrics (their CFO audience expects this)
• Include competitor comparison (they loved this in past projects)
• Use real data visualizations, not stock footage

Does that direction work for you?"
```

[1][2] are clickable citations → open insight detail

**WOW FACTOR #2: Contextual Recommendations**

- Primer isn't just capturing info, it's USING past knowledge
- Citations make it feel researched/credible
- Shows "AI + institutional memory" power

**Psychology:**

- Expertise signal: "Primer knows this client better than I do"
- Value proof: Context is actually USEFUL, not just stored

#### STEP 4: Insight Discovery (1:45 - 2:15)

During conversation:

```
User: "They mentioned they want to target healthcare verticals now,
not just finance"

Primer: "Interesting - that's new! 💡

[Animation - new insight appears in right panel]

┌────────────────────────────────────┐

Plus, I discovered 3 new insights during our conversation:
✓ Healthcare vertical expansion
✓ New dashboard feature focus
✓ Preference for vertical-specific case studies

These insights will help with future Acme briefs.

**WOW FACTOR #3: Automatic Knowledge Accumulation**

- System gets smarter with every conversation
- User sees value compounding
- No manual note-taking needed

**Psychology:**

- Compounding value: "This gets better over time"
- FOMO: "Imagine having 2 years of insights like this"
- Investment framing: "Every brief makes my agency smarter"

#### STEP 5: The Before/After Comparison (2:15 - 2:45)

Final reveal:

**Psychology:**

- Contrast effect: Before/After makes value obvious
- ROI on emotion: Quantify the fear (knowledge loss = 0%)
- Long-term thinking: "Build an asset, not just use a tool"

### Version B Demo - Feature Showcase Priority

| Feature              | Show?       | How?                             | Why?                     |

## Technical Implementation Approach

### Demo Architecture

```
Landing Page (/)
├─ Hero Section
│  ├─ Version A: Problem-first messaging (hours → 2 minutes)
│  └─ Version B: Timeline visual (knowledge loss)
├─ Single CTA: "Experience Primer"
└─ Click → Demo Gate Form

Demo Gate Form (Interstitial)
├─ "Let's personalize this for you (30 seconds)"
├─ Name, Company, Website (optional), Team size
└─ [Generate My Demo] → Loading state (15 sec)

Demo Page (/demo)
├─ Detects variant from URL/cookie
├─ Loads personalized context (from web crawl)
├─ Hybrid approach: Scripted flow + AI-generated insights
├─ Real-time animations and interactions
└─ Ends with combined feedback + waitlist form

Combined Form (Post-Demo)
├─ Email (first time asking)
├─ Free-text feedback: "What impressed you most?"
├─ Feature selection: Which features matter? (checkboxes)
├─ Pain point (optional): Biggest challenge today?
└─ [Join Waitlist] → Thank you page
```

### Demo Data Strategy

#### Option 1: Mock Data (Recommended for MVP)

- Pre-scripted conversation
- Instant responses (no AI latency)
- Controlled, perfect experience
- Fast, cheap, reliable

#### Option 2: Real API Calls

- Actually call PNP platform APIs
- Real AI responses (slower, but authentic)
- Risk: AI could say something weird
- Cost: OpenAI API calls

**Recommendation**: Start with scripted mock for predictability, switch to real API after validating concept.

### Demo UX Implementation

```typescript
// demo-config.ts
export const demoFlows = {
  a: {
    variant: "revenue-growth",
    scenario: {
      template: "video-brief",
      client: "TechStart Inc",
      project: "New product launch video",
    },
    messages: [
      { role: "assistant", content: "👋 Hi! I'm Primer...", delay: 0 },
      { role: "assistant", content: "What's the main objective?", delay: 2000 },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: "Showcase new AI analytics feature",
        delay: 4000,
        autoType: true,
      },
      // ... more messages
    ],
    highlights: [
      {
        timestamp: 15000,
        feature: "extraction",
        message: "Watch sections fill in real-time",
      },
      {
        timestamp: 90000,
        feature: "time-savings",
        message: "Time saved: 2h 58min",
      },
    ],
  },
  b: {
    variant: "knowledge-retention",
    scenario: {
      template: "video-brief",
      client: "Acme Corp",
      context: "New AM replacing departed senior",
    },
    // ... similar structure
  },
};
```

## Landing Page + Demo One-Pager Structure

### Option A: Separate Pages (Recommended)

```
Landing Page: Hero + Value Prop + [Start Demo] CTA
↓
Demo Page: Full interactive experience
↓
Waitlist Modal: Pops up after demo completion
```

**Pros**: Clear focus, better conversion tracking, faster page load

### Option B: Single Scrolling Page

```
Section 1: Hero + Calculator/Timeline
Section 2: Embedded Demo (iframe or component)
Section 3: Features showcase
Section 4: Testimonials (if available)
Section 5: Waitlist form
```

**Pros**: No page transitions, smooth scroll experience
**Cons**: Heavy page, complex tracking, slower load

**Recommendation**: Separate pages - cleaner analytics, better performance

---

## Summary: A/B Test Implementation Plan

### Tech Stack

- **A/B Testing**: PostHog (or custom URL routing)
- **Waitlist Form**: Tally.so embedded (or Supabase custom form)
- **Feedback**: PostHog surveys after demo
- **Analytics**: PostHog session replay + funnels

### Demo Approach

- **Version A**: Speed + Capacity focus (timer, speed comparison, experiential proof)
  - ❌ **NO ROI Calculator** - removed due to lack of real data
  - ✅ **Experience-first** - let demo show value, don't claim it
- **Version B**: Knowledge + Continuity focus (scenario framing, insights showcase, before/after)

### Feature Priority

- **Version A**: Live extraction, time tracking, speed comparison (2 min vs 3 hours)
- **Version B**: Brand Intelligence, insight discovery, citations

---

## DATA COLLECTION STRATEGY

### Two-Touchpoint Approach

**Goal**: Collect enough data for validation without creating friction

**Touchpoint 1: Pre-Demo (Personalization)**

- **When**: After landing page CTA, before demo starts
- **Purpose**: Enable personalized demo experience
- **Fields**:
  - Name (required) - for personalization
  - Company name (required) - for personalization + segmentation
  - Website (optional) - for AI insights generation
  - Team size (required, pre-filled: 5) - for context
- **Total fields**: 3 required + 1 optional = 4 fields
- **Time**: ~30 seconds to complete

**Touchpoint 2: Post-Demo (Commitment + Validation)**

- **When**: After demo completion, combined with waitlist
- **Purpose**: Capture intent and validation insights
- **Fields**:
  - Email (required) - waitlist + follow-up interviews
  - Free-text feedback (required) - "What impressed you most?"
  - Feature preferences (required) - checkboxes, select up to 3:
    - ☐ AI Brief Consultant (what you just saw)
    - ☐ Brand Intelligence Library
    - ☐ Content Production Engine
    - ☐ Client-Facing Brief Links
    - ☐ Team Collaboration Tools
    - ☐ Other: [text input]
  - Pain point (optional) - radio buttons:
    - ○ Staff turnover / knowledge loss
    - ○ Growth ceiling (can't take more clients)
    - ○ Quality inconsistency
    - ○ Training takes too long
    - ○ Other: [text input]
- **Total fields**: 1 email + 1 textarea + 1 multi-select + 1 optional radio
- **Time**: ~1-2 minutes to complete

### What Data Enables

| Data Point          | Collected When       | Enables Us To...                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Name                | Pre-demo             | Personalize demo experience                     |
| Company name        | Pre-demo             | Segment by market, personalize demo             |
| Website             | Pre-demo (optional)  | Generate AI insights, show real capability      |
| Team size           | Pre-demo             | Understand agency scale, segment                |
| **Email**           | **Post-demo**        | **Build waitlist, follow-up interviews**        |
| Free-text feedback  | Post-demo            | Understand what resonates, qualitative insights |
| Feature preferences | Post-demo            | Prioritize product roadmap, validate direction  |
| Pain point          | Post-demo (optional) | Validate positioning angle (A vs B)             |

### Key Principles

1. **Ask once**: Never ask for the same information twice
2. **Value exchange**: Clear why we need each piece of data
3. **Optional fallbacks**: Website is optional, generic insights if skipped
4. **Email last**: Only ask after they've seen value (demo complete)
5. **Combined forms**: Feedback + waitlist in one form (not two)

### What We DON'T Collect (MVP)

- ❌ Phone number (not needed for validation)
- ❌ Company address (not relevant)
- ❌ Role/title (nice to have, but not critical)
- ❌ Current tools used (can ask in follow-up interviews)
- ❌ Budget/pricing preferences (too early)

## HYBRID PERSONALIZATION SYSTEM

### User Flow with Web Crawling

```
Landing Page
  ↓
User enters: Name + Company + Website (optional)
  ↓
[Start Demo] → Shows loading state
  ↓
Backend:
  1. Crawl homepage (5-10 sec) - EXISTING CODE ✅
  2. AI generates insights from crawl (5-10 sec)
  3. AI generates brand context summary
  ↓
Demo Page loads with:
  - Personalized company context
  - 5-8 AI-generated insights
  - Chat ready with context pre-loaded
```

### Benefits of Hybrid Approach

1. **Personalization**: Real company data creates emotional connection
2. **Proof of concept**: Shows actual AI capabilities
3. **User investment**: They gave us info → more likely to complete
4. **Data collection**: We learn about their business for follow-up

### Technical Implementation Notes

- Use existing web crawling code from PNP platform
- Generate insights using GPT-4 from crawled content
- Cache results to avoid re-crawling on page refresh
- Fallback to generic demo if crawl fails

### Loading State Design

```
🔍 Analyzing your company...
  ↓
✓ Website crawled
✓ Brand context generated
✓ AI insights discovered
  ↓
🎉 Your personalized demo is ready!
```
