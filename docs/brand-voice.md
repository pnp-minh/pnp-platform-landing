## Communication Principles

### What We Say
- **Product value**: Experience the AI brief consultant
- **Agency context**: Briefs, clients, team, projects, knowledge
- **Specific outcomes**: Complete briefs, consistent quality, preserved knowledge
- **Their reality**: Turnover challenges, scaling concerns, time constraints

### What We Don't Say
- Technical jargon: "AI-powered insights", "machine learning algorithms"
- Exaggerated claims: "Revolutionary", "game-changing", "transform your business"
- Defensive language: "Promise!", "Don't worry!", "Trust us!"
- Generic benefits: Could apply to any tool
- About ourselves: Long feature lists, company achievements

### Tone Spectrum

**Formal** ←------------------------●----→ **Casual**

We sit slightly left of center: Professional but approachable, like a trusted advisor rather than a corporate vendor.

## Writing Guidelines

### Sentence Structure
- **Short to medium length**: Avoid long, complex sentences
- **Direct but gentle**: Get to the point without being blunt
- **Sparse punctuation**: No excessive exclamation marks or ellipses
- **Active voice**: Clear subject and action

### Word Choice
- **Precise over flowery**: "Complete brief" not "comprehensive documentation package"
- **Concrete over abstract**: "30-minute conversation" not "streamlined process"
- **Agency vocabulary**: Brief, client, project, team, context
- **Avoid**: Buzzwords, superlatives, technical terms, corporate speak

### Content Density
- **Say less, mean more**: One clear point per section
- **White space matters**: Room to breathe
- **No exhaustive lists**: Highlight what matters most
- **Trust the reader**: They don't need every detail upfront

## Voice Checklist

Before publishing any content, ask:

- [ ] Does this sound like a calm, confident advisor?
- [ ] Are we listening/asking questions, not just talking?
- [ ] Have we avoided overselling or listing too many benefits?
- [ ] Is the language clear and specific (not vague or technical)?
- [ ] Does this feel secure without being defensive?
- [ ] Would this resonate with a 35-45 year old agency owner facing turnover?
- [ ] Could we say this more simply or briefly?
- [ ] Are we focused on their experience, not our features?

## Cultural Context: Vietnam

### Additional Considerations
- **Professional maturity**: Appeals to established agency owners (30-45)
- **Quiet confidence**: Success through substance, not flash
- **Relationship-first**: Trust building through understanding, not pitching
- **Practical wisdom**: Proven solutions over theoretical innovation

### Language Bridges
When translating to Vietnamese, maintain:
- Respectful but not overly formal (anh/chị, appropriate honorifics)
- Warmth without familiarity
- Clarity without oversimplification
- Confidence without arrogance

## In Practice

**Our brand personality shows up as**:
- The advisor who asks "How have things been lately?" before proposing solutions
- The colleague in simple elegant clothing who doesn't need to prove anything
- The listener who understands your challenges without you having to explain everything
- The professional who makes you feel secure through clear communication, not promises

**We sound like**: A thoughtful consultant you'd want to have coffee with—someone who listens deeply, speaks clearly, and makes you feel understood.

**We don't sound like**: A startup hustling for attention, a corporate vendor reading from a script, or an overeager salesperson listing features.
