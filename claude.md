## Brand Voice & Tone

**Core Attributes**:
- **Calm**: Gentle invitations, educational tone, not pushy or urgent
- **Confident**: Authority without arrogance, certainty without hedging
- **Sense of Security**: Explicit safety, clear boundaries, reassuring language

**Writing Guidelines**:
- Focus on **product value** (experiencing the AI brief consultant) not technical mechanics
- Use **agency context** language (briefs, clients, team, projects)
- **Professional** but not corporate - accessible expertise
- **Clear scope** - be explicit about what we do/don't do with data
- Avoid: casual slang, defensive language ("promise!", "no spam!"), vague claims

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Experience JAY with your brand" (calm, confident)
- ✅ "Your information is secure. We'll only use it to personalize this demo experience." (security)
- ✅ "See how JAY helps gather a professional brief for your agency" (value-focused)
- ❌ "We'll generate insights from your company" (technical, confusing)
- ❌ "No spam, promise!" (defensive, casual)
